A single command shortcut for merging multiple lines into 1 is "join lines".

Command + J on the Mac to join lines.

CTRL + J on Windows

Edit > Lines > Join Lines

Another approach is seen in the demo animations on sublimetext.com. Using multiple selections, Ctrl+Shift+L is used to split a selection into lines, and each line is then edited simultaneously. end + del will then remove all line breaks. This can be seen in slide 2/6 at http://sublimetexttips.com/7-handy-text-manipulation-tricks-sublime-text-2/
